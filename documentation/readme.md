## Design Philosophy - Dev Environment

### ðŸ’¡ Rule: Hot Reload should be supported during development

Hot Reload is important for frontend development as the changes can be reflected in a very quick manner. Hot reload feature is already supported by the latest version of Nextjs. Any changes on the source files would trigger rebuilding the application automatically.

### ðŸ’¡ Rule: Code Linting is required

Linters are added into this project template to enhance code quality.

For javascript, [eslint](https://eslint.org/) is used, extending rules from [airbnb-base](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb-base) and [react/recommended](https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react)

```sh
#To check js syntax
pnpm lint
```

## Design Philosophy - Application Design

### ðŸ’¡ Rule: Need a clear layout structure

Every page in the same project actually shares the same structure. We make good use of some Nextjs features and some custom components to organize the pages:

#### app/layout.tsx

This is a custom component, which is more about look and feel structure of any page. For a typical webpage, we usually need a define the header, the footer and where to show the main content.

## Design Philosophy - JS

### ðŸ’¡ Rule: Ensure imported modules are universal

Not all javascript libraries can be run on both server and client side. When you pick a module to use, make sure it is universal.

## Design Philosophy - Quality Control

### ðŸ’¡ Rule: Ensure every page can be loaded from server side and client side

The great thing Nextjs provides to us is React with SSR, which means any page can be access from server side and client side. This also means that you have to ensure your page should be functional when entering from server side or client side.
